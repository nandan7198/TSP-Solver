# Travelling Salesman Problem Solver
 This project is a Java implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem solver, which uses the Nearest Neighbor and 2-OPT algorithms. The aim of this project is to find the shortest possible path that visits each node in a given graph exactly once and returns to the starting node.
